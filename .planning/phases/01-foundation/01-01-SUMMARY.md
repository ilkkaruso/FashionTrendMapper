patterns-established:
  - "Root layout pattern: Header → Main (flex-1) → Footer"
  - "Container pattern: container mx-auto px-4 for content width"
  - "Navigation using next/link with hover transitions"
  - "Placeholder pages with centered content structure"

# Phase 01 Plan 01: Next.js Foundation Summary

**Next.js 16 app with TypeScript, Tailwind v4, App Router, and three placeholder routes with shared header/footer navigation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 9 min 20 sec
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T09:06:36Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T09:15:56Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 13

## Accomplishments
- Next.js 16.1.4 application scaffolded with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and ESLint
- Root layout with persistent header navigation (Home | Archive | Admin) and footer
- Three functional routes: home (/), archive (/archive), and admin (/admin) with placeholder content
- Production build succeeds with all routes pre-rendered as static pages

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Next.js 14 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS** - `fc22ede` (chore)
   - Generated by `create-next-app@latest` with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint
   - Includes: package.json, next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, app/ structure, public/ assets

2. **Task 2: Create basic page structure with header navigation and footer** - `695ca59` (feat)
   - Updated app/layout.tsx with header (logo + nav) and footer (copyright + affiliate disclosure)
   - Replaced app/page.tsx with placeholder home content
   - Created app/archive/page.tsx for trend archive route
   - Created app/admin/page.tsx for admin dashboard route

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with header navigation (Home | Archive | Admin) and footer with affiliate disclosure
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page placeholder ("Fashion Trends")
- `app/archive/page.tsx` - Archive page placeholder ("Trend Archive")
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin page placeholder ("Admin Dashboard")
- `package.json` - Next.js 16.1.4, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS v4
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration (empty/default)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path aliases (@/*)
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration with Next.js rules
- `app/globals.css` - Tailwind directives and base styles
- `public/*.svg` - Default Next.js SVG assets (next.svg, vercel.svg, etc.)

**Modified:**
- None (initial creation)

## Decisions Made

1. **Used Inter font instead of default Geist**
   - Rationale: Cleaner, more professional look for fashion content; widely supported

2. **Header navigation as horizontal links with gap-6**
   - Rationale: Keeps navigation minimal and unobtrusive per CONTEXT.md ("bubbles take full focus")

3. **Footer includes affiliate disclosure upfront**
   - Rationale: Transparency requirement for future affiliate links; standard e-commerce practice

4. **Light mode only (no dark mode toggle)**
   - Rationale: Per CONTEXT.md, "Light mode default gives cleaner, more fashion-forward feel"

5. **Container pattern with mx-auto for content width**
   - Rationale: Prevents content stretching on wide screens; maintains readability

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The plan specified using create-next-app with TypeScript and Tailwind, creating three routes with header/footer, and all was implemented as designed.

## Issues Encountered

**1. Directory naming conflict during create-next-app**
- **Issue:** FashionTrendMapper directory name contains capital letters, violating npm package naming restrictions
- **Solution:** Created app in temporary `fashion-trend-mapper` directory, then copied contents to FashionTrendMapper directory
- **Impact:** Minimal - added 30 seconds to Task 1 execution

No other issues encountered. Build succeeded, all routes accessible, TypeScript compilation clean.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. Application runs entirely locally with `npm run dev`.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for next phases:**
- Application structure established for Supabase integration (Phase 1 Plan 2)
- Routes exist for all planned pages (home trends, archive, admin)
- Build pipeline works for Vercel deployment (Phase 1 Plan 3)
- Tailwind CSS configured for custom styling in visualization phase

**No blockers.** Foundation is stable and ready for database integration.
