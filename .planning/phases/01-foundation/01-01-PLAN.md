<objective>
Create the Next.js 14 application foundation with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router. Establish basic page structure with routes for home, archive, and admin pages with minimal header navigation and standard footer.

Purpose: Provide the core application framework that all other features will build upon.

Output: Working Next.js 14 app with three accessible routes, ready for Supabase integration and deployment.

  <action>
    Run `npx create-next-app@latest` with the following configuration:
    - Project name: fashion-trend-mapper (or use current directory)
    - TypeScript: Yes
    - ESLint: Yes
    - Tailwind CSS: Yes
    - src/ directory: No (keep app/ at root for simplicity)
    - App Router: Yes
    - Import alias: @/* (default)

    This will scaffold a Next.js 14 project with all required dependencies and configuration files. Do NOT customize further - accept recommended defaults as specified in RESEARCH.md.

    After creation, verify package.json contains:
    - next version ~14.x
    - react, react-dom
    - typescript
    - tailwindcss
    - @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `npm run dev` and confirm app starts without errors
    - Visit http://localhost:3000 and confirm default Next.js page loads
    - Check package.json shows "next": "^14.x.x"
  </verify>
  <done>
    Next.js 14 app created with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and App Router. Development server starts successfully and default page renders.

  <action>
    Replace app/layout.tsx with root layout containing:
    - Minimal header with "Fashion Trend Mapper" logo text (left-aligned, bold)
    - Header navigation: Home | Archive | Admin (horizontal links with gap-6)
    - Border bottom on header (border-b)
    - {children} slot for page content
    - Standard footer with border top (border-t), contains:
      - Copyright "© 2026 Fashion Trend Mapper"
      - Affiliate disclosure: "We may earn commissions from featured products."
      - Text size: text-sm, color: text-gray-600
      - Container with padding: px-4 py-6
    - Use Inter font from next/font/google (already imported by create-next-app)
    - Set metadata: title "Fashion Trend Mapper", description "Interactive visualization of current fashion trends"

    Replace app/page.tsx with placeholder home page:
    - Simple container with centered text
    - Heading: "Fashion Trends" (h1, text-3xl, font-bold)
    - Paragraph: "Trend visualization coming soon..." (text-gray-600)

    Create app/archive/page.tsx:
    - Similar placeholder layout
    - Heading: "Trend Archive" (h1, text-3xl, font-bold)
    - Paragraph: "Past trends will appear here..." (text-gray-600)

    Create app/admin/page.tsx:
    - Similar placeholder layout
    - Heading: "Admin Dashboard" (h1, text-3xl, font-bold)
    - Paragraph: "Admin controls coming soon..." (text-gray-600)

    All pages should use Tailwind classes. Header should be sticky or fixed is Claude's discretion. Light mode default (no dark mode toggle yet).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `npm run dev`
    - Visit http://localhost:3000 - see "Fashion Trends" heading with header/footer
    - Click "Archive" link - navigate to /archive with "Trend Archive" heading
    - Click "Admin" link - navigate to /admin with "Admin Dashboard" heading
    - Click "Home" link - return to /
    - Confirm header appears on all pages
    - Confirm footer appears on all pages with affiliate disclosure
  </verify>
  <done>
    Three routes (/, /archive, /admin) are accessible with placeholder content. Root layout includes minimal header with working navigation links and standard footer with affiliate disclosure. All pages render with Tailwind styles in light mode.
  </done>
